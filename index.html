                <p>Building a social media presence for your small business can feel a lot more complicated than it needs to. According to the Social Media Examiner's 2016 report, most small business owners think social media is important to their business, but they are not sure exactly why, or how they should be using the various available platforms. </p>
                <p>Maybe youâ€™ve noticed that there is a lot of self-serving and conflicting information available online, and it can be difficult to determine what exactly you should be doing. Maybe you are just uncomfortable with promoting yourself or your business on social media.</p>
                <p>If this sounds like you, I might be able to help.</p>
                <p>Happy Posting,</p>
