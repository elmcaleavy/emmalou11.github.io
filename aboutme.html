    <h2 class="red">Hi, I'm Emma.</h2>

My first job out of college, I went to work for Windermere Real Estate/Capitol Hill in Seattle.  My boss, Pat Grimm was an incredible man, and amazing first boss.  Pat had a  “relationships first” approach to sales, and he always tried to empower his employees and agents. Pat let me take over the office social media presence, and soon I was organizing training sessions for the agents in the office as well.  To my surprise and delight nearly all of our 50 agents showed up to my first social media workshop.  I will never forget the admiration I felt for one of our eighty-year-old agents who struggled for nearly two hours to download a picture from dropbox and share it to her Facebook page.
