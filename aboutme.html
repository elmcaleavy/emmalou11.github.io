    <h2 class="red">Hi, I'm Emma.</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        After college, I went to work for Windermere Real Estate/Capitol Hill in Seattle. My boss, Pat, had a “relationships first” approach to sales, and he always tried to empower his employees and agents to fulfill their potential. Pat let me take over the office social media presence, and soon I was organizing workshops and individual training sessions for agents, as well as managing the office’s social media presence. To my delight nearly all of our 50 agents showed up to my first workshop. I will never forget the admiration I felt for one of our eighty-year-old agents who struggled for nearly two hours to download a picture from dropbox and share it to her Facebook page.
        <p>As much as I loved Pat and the agents at Windermere, I soon found myself looking for a new challenge, and I found one at Microsoft. As a consultant in digital marketing operations I learned the ins and out of project management for localization and web development. While the work we were doing was on a global scale, it continues to inform my small-bussiness marketing and social media work.</p>
        <p> After Microsoft, I moved to Mexico to teach as a Fulbright fellow at the Universidad Tecnológica De Los Valles Centrales. I improved my Spanish, made some incredible friends, and learned to appreciate the power of social media to sustain conntections with friends and family even when you are far away. </p>

        <p>Now I enjoy helping small businesses and individuals learn how to craft and manage their social media presence.
